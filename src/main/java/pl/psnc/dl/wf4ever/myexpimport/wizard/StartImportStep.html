				wicket:id="workflowsCnt">0</span> workflows and <span
				wicket:id="filesCnt">0</span> files have been found in your

		</p>
		<p>This wizard allows you to copy your resources
			(workflows/files/packs) from myExperiment to dLibra, aggregating them
			as Research Objects (RO). The wizard will help you to select how you
			want to aggregate these resources.</p>
		<p>Since the actual structure of RO and its metadata is still
			under development, for every imported resource its accompanying RDF
			file will also be transfered to make sure that the metadata will be
			available for processing in the future.</p>
		<p>The wizard has the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Choose which workspace you want to import to.</li>
			<li>Define Research Objects <i>(these steps can be repeated
					many times)</i>:
				<ol>
					<li>Select resources. Choose if you want to import all
						selected resources as 1 RO <strong>or</strong> every resource as a
						separate RO.
					</li>
					<li>Choose RO names.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Create ROs in dLibra, copy selected resources from
				myExperiment to dLibra.</li>
			<li>Summary.</li>
