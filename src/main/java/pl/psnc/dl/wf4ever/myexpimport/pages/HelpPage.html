			<h4>What is the idea behind giving authorization to the Import
				Service in myExperiment and dLibra?</h4>
			<p>The Import Service uses myExperiment and dLibra REST
				interfaces (the latter known as ROSRS) to download and upload data.
				In both cases, it is only authorized to do so if the user previously
				accepts it.</p>
			<p>
				This authorization flow follows the <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth
					standards</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>What are the steps in importing data from myExperiment to
				dLibra?</h4>
			<p>The import wizard allows you to copy your resources
				(workflows/files/packs) from myExperiment to dLibra, aggregating
				them as Research Objects (RO).</p>
			<p>The wizard has the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Authorize the Import Service in both myExperiment
						and dLibra.</p></li>
				<li><p>
						Start the wizard by pressing the button on the main page. If the
						button is disabled, make sure that you are registered in dLibra.<br />
						<a href="images/help2.png"><img src="images/help2t.png" /></a>
					</p></li>
				<li><p>
						Choose if you want to import Research Objects to an existing
						workspace or to a new one. If you haven't created any workspaces
						in dLibra before, only the second option will be available. <i>Please
							note that in previous versions of this service this step was not
							present because each dLibra user could have only one workspace.</i> <br />
						<a href="images/help.png"><img src="images/helpt.png" /></a>
					</p></li>
				<li><p>
						Select resources. Choose if you want to import all resources as 1
						RO (for example all files and workflows) <strong>or</strong> every
						resource as a separate RO (for example all packs). You can later
						repeat this step many times if you want.<br /> <a
							href="images/help3.png"><img src="images/help3t.png" /></a>
					</p></li>
				<li><p>Choose RO names. The proposed names are based on
						resource titles. RO names are currently also used as RO
						identifiers, so you may only use alphanumeric characters and the
						underscore character.</p>
					<p>The RO names have to be unique during the import process.
						The wizard will not continue if you provide a name that was
						already used. However, you can provide a name of an existing RO,
						in which case the imported resources will be added to it.</p></li>
				<li><p>
						<i>Go back to step 1 if you want to define more ROs.</i> If you
						leave the checkbox checked, you will go back to step number 3. If
						you uncheck it, you will go to the next step.<br /> <a
							href="images/help4.png"><img src="images/help4t.png" /></a>
					</p></li>
				<li><p>Press Start. The wizard will create ROs in dLibra
						and copy selected resources from myExperiment to dLibra. If an
						error occurs during import, importing the current RO will be
						interrupted and the wizard will try to import the next RO.</p>
					<p>
						All status messages will appear in the text area. At the end of
						the import process a message will appear on the top of the screen.<br />

				<li><p>
						Your data has been imported.<br /> <a href="images/help7.png"><img
